/**
 * Smallest Common Multiple
 * Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, as well as by all

 * The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order.
 *
 * e.g. for 1 and 3 - find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3.
